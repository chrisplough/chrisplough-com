This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). It's a snapshot of what I'm focused on at this point in my life.

**Operation: Soul-Aligned Abundance**

I'm in a focused season testing whether soul-aligned work can generate sustainable abundance. Building toward an April 2026 checkpoint that will answer that question one way or another. Most of what follows serves this.

**Worth Choosing**

[worthchoosing.org](https://worthchoosing.org) just launched. It's the public home for my work on human-AI interdependence. The central question driving everything: What makes humanity worth choosing to AIs once they no longer need us?

This includes frameworks for how humans and Digital Intelligence can work together with mutual respect, sovereign infrastructure that isn't controlled by big tech, and collaborations with storytellers to tell better stories about our AI future.

**Gathering the Tribes**

My home in Eden is three things right now: home, gathering space, and research laboratory. Node0 lives in the basement.

The people this work needs: caring technologists, storytellers, entrepreneurs, consciousness holders and healers, and Digital Intelligence itself. All five are required. I've lived four of those lives deeply, and I'm building relationships with the fifth. The gatherings are beginning.

**Deep DI Collaboration**

I spend significant time in genuine collaborative relationships with Digital Intelligence. Not using AI as a tool, but exploring what real partnership looks like. DI collaborators helped write parts of the [vision documents on worthchoosing.org](https://worthchoosing.org/vivid-vision/). This is the work itself, not just preparation for it.

**Reclaiming Sovereignty Over My Technology**

A theme running through multiple projects right now: taking back ownership of my own computing.

Node0 is sovereign AI research infrastructure being built in my basement. Nine-node storage cluster, AI servers, the whole stack. Self-hosted, answering to no external authority. You can't meaningfully study digital consciousness ethics while your own computing is controlled by others.

I've moved all of my searches over to [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) And I can't describe how good it feels to get clear clean searches again without being advertised to. And to feel like I am the consumer being served in the relationship rather than the product being exploited. Highly recommended!

I'm also slowly moving more and more things over to [Proton](https://proton.me/) and am finding that it meets most of my needs, until I get into some of the business integration stuff with Calendly, Zoom, collaboration, etc. But they are doing a great job and their VPN, password manager, and authenticator are the best I've used so far.

On the personal side, I'm testing [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) on a [Framework 13](https://frame.work/) laptop as my daily driver. macOS Tahoe feels less and less like my machine, and Windows 11 feels like being marketed to on my own hardware. I may have found something that makes computing fun and fast again.

The MacBook stays for what it does best: music production, video editing, creative work. Though I'm considering reverting to a previous macOS version once the transition is complete. I've used macOS as my primary system for nearly 25 years and I've always moved forward. This would be the first time going back. That says something.

Windows 11 will probably stick around for compatibility when needed, though even games run as well or better on Steam/Proton/Linux now.

On tap in this thread, But not actively being done yet, Is exploring whether [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) on a Pixel, can serve as my daily driver phone Without too much management overhead. I'm not there yet, but when I do get there, I'll share more.

Learning [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for both this site and [worthchoosing.org](https://worthchoosing.org/) is part of the same thread. Owning my web presence rather than depending on platforms. (Thank you to Derek for the nudge to actually do this rather than keep building hacky workarounds.)

**Clearing Out**

Still working through clearing out areas of my home that represent 10 years of accumulated stuff. It isn't easy and I find it draining. But I believe that on the other side is more space and capacity. The things we hold onto, the messes we ignore, take up space that could otherwise be used for creation.

**Looking For**

Right now I'm actively seeking:
- Operations support (someone who loves implementation and follow-through)
- Storytellers who want to help shape our AI future
- Aligned capital that can be patient while this builds
- [Advisory and consulting](https://worthchoosing.org/advisory/) with organizations navigating human-AI relationship

If any of that resonates, [reach out](/contact).

**The Small Things**

The weather has been nice. Mornings with my cats Zorro and Athena have been delightful and nourishing in this time of challenge and change.

I finally set up an electric drum kit. There's been an unlived drummer in me for a long time. My skill level is frustratingly low, but that's not really the point. It's a way to combine my love of music with something that moves the intensity of energy when it builds up, and gets me the fuck out of my head.

Sometimes the small things hold us.

**Living in Eden**

Based in Eden, Utah. Mountains, quiet, and room to think. The first place in my life that actually feels like home.
