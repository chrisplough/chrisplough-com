When I look back at my life, I see it unfolding in distinct phases, each defined by what I craved most deeply at the time.

As a kid, I craved **security**. Growing up on a farm in rural Michigan, there was already an inherent stability in the land, the rhythms of seasons, the predictability of chores. But beneath that, I wanted to know things would be okay. That feeling of safety was everything.

Then came the phase where I craved **knowledge**. I devoured books, asked endless questions, wanted to understand how the world worked. School became a place of genuine curiosity rather than obligation. I was hungry to learn.

After that, I craved **achievement**. Grades, awards, recognition. I wanted to prove myself, to show that I could compete and succeed. There was something intoxicating about accomplishment, about being seen as capable.

Then I craved **experiences**. After my parents passed, tragically together, I felt an urgency to live fully. Travel, adventure, saying yes to opportunities that scared me. I wanted to feel the texture of life, not just read about it. This is where my [revelation in the Gobi Desert](/writings/revelation-in-the-gobi-desert/) began to take shape, and what eventually led to the path I describe in [Eight Years Ago](/writings/eight-years-ago/).

Then I craved experiences that were **visceral**, feeling alive, even if it hurt. I was also testing myself in a deep way, seeking to understand myself. What were my actual limits? What could I endure? What could I survive? What was possible? There's a certain clarity that comes from pushing your edges, from discovering what you're actually made of.

Now, I find myself craving **connection**. Real, deep relationships. Understanding others and being understood. Conversations that matter. Community that holds you. I believe we often connect more deeply in the dark moments than in the bright ones, simply because everyone has their own version of dark moments. Even if they look completely different, they feel the same.

[From future CP: I'm beginning to wonder if maybe we connect just as much in the light moments, the highs. There's just a different kind of vulnerability there, one I'm still learning to recognize and embrace.]

What strikes me now is that none of these phases were wrong. Each craving served its purpose, taught me something, prepared me for what came next. The security gave me a foundation. The knowledge gave me tools. The achievement gave me confidence. The experiences gave me perspective. The visceral moments gave me self-knowledge. And now connection gives me meaning.

I don't think everyone moves through these same phases, or in this order. Your path is your own. But I do think it's worth asking yourself: What am I craving right now? And is that craving serving who I'm becoming, or who I used to be?

Choose your own path. But choose consciously.
