*Back when the Internet was still pretty new and before MMOs (massively multiplayer online games) like World of Warcraft, there were [MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD). Text-based adventure games. It was in one of these that I met a wonderful girl (now an amazing woman) that I fell deeply in love with.*

*This was the description of the room I created for us.*

## Stone and Winter's Room

This room is filled with many antique objects collected throughout the many travels that Stone and Wintersong had made together...

There is a beautiful stain glass window showing a breathtaking view of a forest in the distance....

At the edge of the forest is a small lake surrounded by a field...

The room itself is dimly lit by an old antique lamp which sits on a small table in the middle of the room..

There is a bookshelf against one wall and a comfortable looking couch beside it which will comfortably fit two people...

Against the wall is a professionally made portrait of Stone and Wintersong together in a loving embrace...

Your eyes are drawn to the expressions of love and happiness on their faces, which can be felt as you walk into this room...

You feel overwhelmed with happiness and peace as you gaze upon the artifacts and the portrait....

Just as you think you have seen everything in the room....

your gaze is drawn to another corner...

There is a loveseat here amidst the shadows, right next to a cozy fireplace..and sitting on this loveseat are two stuffed teddylions.. both of them looking at you with an expression of contentment and peace.
