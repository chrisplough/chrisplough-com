![What I Want You to Know](/images/what-i-want-you-to-know.jpg)

What I want you to know,
To feel as deep as you are able,
Within the marrow of your bones,
And the seat of your soul,
And all the corners of your mind,
And in your darkest moments...

Is that it all ends well.
That you will be all right.
That you are cared for and Loved.
That suffering ends.
That Joy is abundant.
That it requires far less effort than you believe...

You are far more capable than you think you are.
Believe in You.
You are enough.
Now.
Right Now.
You are enough.
