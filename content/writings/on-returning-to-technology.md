*This is a placeholder for a reflection on returning to technology work.*

In 2016, I sold my company and walked away from tech. I needed to understand what it means to be human before I could build technology that serves humanity.

Eight years later, I came back. But I'm not the same person, and the technology isn't the same either.

The questions I'm asking now are different:

- What makes us worth choosing?
- How do we build genuine interdependence rather than dependence?
- What would it look like to treat AI as a partner rather than a tool?

*Content to come.*
