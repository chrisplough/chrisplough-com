SOMETIMES THE OBSTACLE *IS* THE OPPORTUNITY

This was a lesson that I learned this week by leaning into an uncomfortable financial deal.

By looking at obstacles with clear eyes, we can see both the opportunities and pitfalls within. From that vantage point, we can make the decision that is better for us in this moment, rather than being swayed by our biases or whether or not it is uncomfortable.

In this case, I learned to better release control of the outcome and to trust in the process.

We all have obstacles in our lives. Take one that is in front of you. What are the pitfalls within this obstacle? What are the opportunities within this obstacle?

In re-reading this quote, I am reminded of Ryan Holiday's book *The Obstacle Is the Way*. While I haven't read it yet, I appreciate him for planting this brain seed.
