![Fuller or emptier reflection](/images/fuller-or-emptier.jpg)

They say the universe leaves clues. I know for sure the unconscious does. Our intuition does. This clue is simple and profound.

Do you feel Fuller or emptier after _____? (yesterday, work, spending time with someone, etc.)

You can feel Fuller even when times are hard. You can feel emptier even when times are easy.

This hint helps you understand whether you're moving toward or away from challenges, people, situations that fulfill you. Ful-FILLED.

What does this feeling tell you?

Are you going to listen to it?

What will you do?

You don't have to do anything today, even though it is encouraged. Allowing yourself to be aware of this feeling and not blocking it off or distracting is a beautiful first step. Take the first step. Continue onward as you are ready.
