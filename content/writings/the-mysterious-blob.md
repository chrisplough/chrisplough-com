## The Mysterious Blob
**by Chip Plough**

One day all of a sudden a strange blob appeared under my rug. I tried to hit it with a broom but it was just too fast and it kept hitting things. It hit the coffee table and my lamp shattered. Everything suddenly went dark. When I finally lit a candle I saw that my house was a complete disaster. The blob had disappeared.

I had thought it was a mouse so I put mouse traps all over the house. Then I went to bed. When I woke up I checked all of the traps but they were gone. I went into the kitchen. When I got there something snapped and hurt my foot. I glanced down and saw all of my mouse traps. I turned around to walk away, but the mouse traps attacked me. They were flying!! I started to run but they followed. Soon I was too tired to walk. They caught up with me. After all of them had snapped me, my muscles ached and I had a head-ache.

Two weeks passed and it happened again. The blob finally came from under the rug. It had wings, sharp teeth, and steel claws.

The creature turned into a giant crow and attacked me. He kept poking me with his claws and beak. After 10 minutes I was very weak and tired. Thank goodness he turned into....whatever he was and disappeared.

The creature looked familiar. I looked in all of my books about mystical creatures. It took me 3 hours to find it. Wouldn't you know it - he was on the last page of the last book!! He was a Magical Demon. I also found out that the only one who could help me was the Wizard Believer. The only way I could contact him was to say "Mumuf Wizuf Wizard I Believe," before going to bed. When I got tired I said "Mumuf Wizuf Wizard I Believe" and fell asleep.

I started to dream. In my dream I saw something that looked like a funnel except that it was made of all different colors with a bright white light at the very center. I walked toward the light. When I entered the light I heard a voice say, "if you want help with your trouble get through this maze on the double."

All of a sudden a maze appeared. The maze's walls were mossy and old. I could tell it hadn't been used in a long time. During the time I was in the maze I saw lots of illusions. One looked like a mad dog and another one looked like fire. When I got to the end of the maze I saw an old man. He had a mustache, a beard, and long white hair that hadn't been combed in a long time. He said, "to destroy the demon you must mix garlic, corn meal, and sulfer."

"Sprinkle this mixture on yourself and the Demon will not be able to harm you. Then mix nightshade and sulfer ash, and put it in a black widows web to hold it together. Throw this at the demon and say, 'By Asgard and Lord British Thee Disbelieve!!' Now mix spiders ash, lizard tongue, paprica, gunpowder, and mendlin root. Sprinkle this on the demon but beware as soon as you say the magic words the demon can kill you and you must sprinkle the third formula on him in ten seconds or he will become immortal. 'Fairwell,' said the wizard and then I woke up.

Quickly I wrote down everything so I wouldn't forget any of it. Getting all of the materials was hard and took three weeks.

About one week later the demon appeared again. Quickly I sprinkled the first mixture on myself. Luckly I made three of the second formula. I messed up on the first and it blew-up my fireplace. The second one destroyed my coffee table. But the third one hit the demon. I said, "By Asgard and Lord British Thee Disbelieve!" I fumbled through my pockets and found the third mixture and tossed it. When it hit the demon he blew up. That was the last time I ever saw the demon.

**THE END**
