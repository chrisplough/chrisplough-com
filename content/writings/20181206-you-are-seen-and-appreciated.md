YOU ARE SEEN AND APPRECIATED

To those who have been friends through the fun and the hard times.

To those who have helped others see what they couldn't.

To those that helped calm the rage and heal the wounded child.

To those who care for both themselves and for others.

To those who are brave enough to be vulnerable.

To those who have freely given and received love.

To those who have walked through the darkness and continue toward the light.

To those who light the way.

To those who aren't there yet and will be.

You are seen and appreciated.
