I wanted to share this with you. This is the Presidential Suite in the Alex Johnson Hotel in Rapid City, SD. A place where presidents have stayed, including Roosevelt and Eisenhower.

I wasn't aware of the history when I booked it. Instead, I was just looking for a place to enjoy a nice long Epsom salt bath after a 17-day, 4000-mile road trip. (You see, my place doesn't have a bathtub.) As it happens, this suite was available and I figured, "What the hell." It evolved from there. What began as a place to have a bath became a solo date night. I took myself out to see Bohemian Rhapsody and revel in the story of an artist who went all in. Something the deeply resonates. Then I took myself out for a fine dinner — a western bacon cheeseburger and some bourbon on the rocks. After that, I checked into the hotel and got a surprise. Every room is a bit different and many of the walls are curved. It may seem strange, though even that makes it feel more presidential; reminiscent of the Oval Office.

Yes, the decor is dated and feels like the 70's. That makes it even better. As I lay down on the couch, I felt as if I was transported back in time, and was relaxing in my suite, before sitting down for an interview with Barbara Walters. Maybe it was my imagination, but I could feel an energy about the place. Then, I took a looooong bath and slept well, laying my head where past Presidents have.

When I awoke in the morning, I decided to sit on the couch and meditate. To bask in the sunlight streaming in through the window and enjoy the morning quiet. To invite in the wisdom and guidance of great men who have often had to make difficult decisions involving the lives of many others. To feel what that must have been like. The warm care, the electric tension, the weight of worry and, yes, even the burden of ego. Knowing that only a small sliver of time separated us. I found peace in that room.

Our environment affects us. And we affect our environment. Sometimes we feel stuck because we surround ourselves with an unchanging environment. Where could you take yourself today which will change your state? Lift your emotions and thoughts so that you can see yourself — your needs, your wants, your desires, your abilities — as you are today. Without the constraints of the past or the expectations of others. Will you go?
