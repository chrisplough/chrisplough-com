The lesson I learned today from Shelby:

> When you're lost and blinded by the struggle, true friends lend their sight - their clearer view of the world - until you find your way.
> —Christoph Plough

Her words are more eloquent:

> You are of great worth.
> My life is better simply because you exist.
> No person or thing can replace the happiness that you bring to my world.
> Beautiful things are in your future.
> I promise you that all of these words are true. If you don't feel they are, it's only because your struggles blind you right now. Trust my eyes to be yours until you feel better. You are a gift. ❤️
> —Shelby Larson
