*This is a placeholder for an essay from 1996. The actual content will be added later.*

At 19, I wrote about being "hard-wired diverse" - the tendency to see every problem from multiple angles, to understand that the same situation looks completely different depending on where you're standing.

I didn't know then that this would become central to everything I'd build 30 years later.
