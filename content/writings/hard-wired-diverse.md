*I wrote this essay for a grant application so I could afford to move to Pennsylvania (for love) and go to Penn State. At 19, I described myself as "hard-wired diverse" — the tendency to see every problem from multiple angles, to understand that the same situation looks completely different depending on where you're standing.*

*I didn't know then that this phrase would become central to everything I'd build 30 years later.*

## About Me

Hi! Pleased to meet you! I'm Chris. Well, I guess you would like to know a bit about me, so let me think of where to start... I guess I'm what would be called a 'Diverse Person'. By that I mean that I have many interests and likings that are not always inter-related with one another. For instance, academically I am strongly compelled to learn about both programming and the inner workings of computers, yet I also have interests and curiosities in psychology and law. For fun, I like to do anything from enjoying the company of friends to working on old cars to spending hours at a time in a quiet library. Musically, I am inclined to listen to good old Rock and Roll, yet at times I greatly enjoy the melodies of Mozart and Gregorian Chants.

Sometimes this 'hard-wired' diversity of mine comes in very handy when I'm trying to work out a problem. I use it to look at the problems from many angles and in different situations, and thus make them easier to solve and relate into my own experience. I have done this both for academic problems, problems at work (I am a welder/construction assistant), and in my own personal life.

I don't mean to say that I'm different than most people; I enjoy many of the same things they do: the smell of rain, the sounds of a calm forest, the beauty of Gothic buildings, the comfort of an overstuffed chair, and the satisfaction of succeeding.

Hmm, well this is a little of who I am. Hopefully we will get to share more in the future. Till then...
