Many times a simple picture is better than a lot of words. Take the drawing above - a friend (and potential partner) sent me one like it today.

Here are the words that came to mind when I read it.

> The best partnerships = mutual respect of abilities with a separation of responsibilities based on capabilities.
> —CP

(That said - there's a zillion ways to express something. Find the way that works best for you.)
