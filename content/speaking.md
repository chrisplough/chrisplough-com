## From Empty to Full-Filled

I had everything - seven-figure business, the house, the cars - and I was empty. This is the story of driving an ambulance 10,000 miles from the UK to Mongolia, and what I found in the Gobi Desert. [Read the backstory.](/writings/inbound-bold-talk/)

## Speaking Topics

What I can be booked to speak on:

- **Human-AI interdependence** - What makes humanity worth choosing, and how we navigate relationship with AI that's becoming more capable.
- **From empty to full-filled** - Success without fulfillment, and the shift from ambition to meaning.
- **Transformation through challenge** - What extreme experiences teach us about who we really are.
- **The list that saved my life** - Practical tools for the darkest moments, and breaking cycles of depression and suicidal ideation.
- **Building companies that matter** - Entrepreneurship grounded in purpose, not just profit.

**Formats:** Keynotes (30-60 min). Workshops and intensives (half-day to multi-day). Panels and podcasts.

Workshops go deeper - interactive sessions where participants work with the material, not just hear it. If something here resonates, [reach out](/contact/)
