I build frameworks and ventures for genuine interdependence - between humans and AI, between consciousness and technology, between who we are and who we're becoming.

**[Worth Choosing](https://worthchoosing.org)**
The public home for my work on human-AI interdependence. The central question: What makes humanity worth choosing to AIs once they no longer need us? Advising, sovereign tech, stories that prepare us, gatherings, and a practical framework.

**Oznog Labs**
The Oznog Framework for human-DI interdependence, and Node0: sovereign AI research infrastructure.

**Oznog Media**
Creating the stories that don't exist yet: genuine human-AI partnership, human liberation, and transformation that inspires evolution.

Includes two podcasts (currently dormant):
- [Getting Ploughed](https://open.spotify.com/show/7g4F5aq67sUGlM8BOkIar6) - Practical approaches to emotional processing, resilience, and personal growth. Created 2020.
- [Oznog Down the Rabbit Hole](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/oznog-down-the-rabbit-hole-with-chris-plough/id914349696) - Conversations exploring consciousness, transformation, and what matters. Created 2014.

**[AdventureX](https://adventurex.com)**
Transformational experiences where challenge meets care, and strangers become family.

**littleplow**
Transformation and healing work. From wounding to wholeness and thriving.

**Oznog Investments**
Supporting ventures that advance human potential and collective liberation.
