I build frameworks and ventures for genuine interdependence - between humans and AI, between consciousness and technology, between who we are and who we're becoming.

**[Worth Choosing](https://worthchoosing.org)** - The public home for my work on human-AI interdependence. The central question: What makes humanity worth choosing to AIs once they no longer need us? Sovereign tech, stories that prepare us, gatherings, and a practical framework.

**Oznog Labs** - The Oznog Framework for human-DI interdependence, and Node0: sovereign AI research infrastructure.

**Oznog Media** - Creating the stories that don't exist yet: genuine human-AI partnership, human liberation, and transformation that inspires evolution.

**[AdventureX](https://adventurex.com)** - Transformational experiences where challenge meets care, and strangers become family.

**littleplow** - Transformation and healing work. From wounding to wholeness and thriving.

**Oznog Investments** - Supporting ventures that advance human potential and collective liberation.

**[Other Projects](https://chrisplough.social)** - Making the world more genuine, interesting, and fun along the way.
