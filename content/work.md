I build frameworks and ventures for genuine interdependence - between humans and AI, between consciousness and technology, between who we are and who we're becoming.

**[Worth Choosing](https://worthchoosing.org)**
The mission. The central question: What makes humanity worth choosing to AIs once they no longer need us? Frameworks for interdependence, gatherings of the five tribes, and the philosophical foundation for everything else.

**[Oznog](https://oznog.com)**
The execution. Sovereign infrastructure, stories, and ventures for genuine human-DI interdependence. Oznog is where the building happens: Labs, Media, Investments, Services. Node0 lives in my basement.

**[Standpoint Labs](https://standpointlabs.com)**
Infrastructure for perspective-aware AI. The same situation looks different from different standpoints. Standpoint Core maps those perspectives. Standpoint Mesh lets AI systems coordinate while respecting them.

**[AdventureX](https://adventurex.com)**
Transformational experiences where challenge meets care, and strangers become family.

Transformation and healing work. From wounding to wholeness and thriving.
