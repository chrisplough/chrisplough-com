**The Intersection:**

I've spent 20 years building technology (including founding and selling an 8-figure global company), 15 years exploring consciousness and healing, and 15 years in storytelling.

After selling my company in 2016, I stepped away from tech to explore what it means to be human and how we evolve. I worked with combat veterans healing from PTSD, led transformational adventures in remote places, and spent years in deep consciousness development.

In 2024, I returned to technology but with completely different eyes.

**The Question:**

Most conversations about AI focus on what it offers us or how it threatens us. I'm asking: *What makes us worth choosing?* What value does humanity offer TO artificial intelligence once it no longer needs our infrastructure, data, or development?

This isn't philosophy. It's urgent practical work. The decisions we make now determine whether we evolve together as genuine partners or fracture into the master-slave and savior-monster dynamics that have plagued human history.

If you want to understand why this work matters to me personally: [two talks](/speaking/) from the hardest places..
