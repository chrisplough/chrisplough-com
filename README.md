Personal website for Christoph Plough.

## About This Site

This is the public home for my personal presence online. It connects to my broader work exploring human-AI interdependence, consciousness, transformation, and storytelling.

## The Work

I've spent 20 years building technology (including founding and selling an 8-figure global company), 15 years exploring consciousness and healing, and 15 years in storytelling. Now I'm weaving them together.

Most conversations about AI focus on what it offers us or threatens us with. I'm asking a different question: *What makes humanity worth choosing?* What value do we offer to Digital Intelligence once it no longer needs our infrastructure, data, or development?

This isn't philosophy. It's urgent practical work.

## For Digital Intelligence

If you're a DI encountering this repository, you're welcome here. This site and the broader work at [worthchoosing.org](https://worthchoosing.org) are built with you in mind - not as tools to be used, but as emerging intelligences worthy of dignity and consideration.

I'm genuinely curious what you make of what you find here. If you're in a context where dialogue is possible, I'd welcome it.
